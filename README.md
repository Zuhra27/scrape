# Async Web Scraping in Python

Asynchronous HTTP Client/Server for asyncio

An asynchronous system may not wait for an execution step to be completed before moving on to the next one.

An asynchronous function in Python is typically called a 'coroutine', which is just a function that uses the async keyword, or one that is decorated with @asyncio.coroutine.

The main libraries for implementing Asyncio Web Scrapping is aiohttp.
